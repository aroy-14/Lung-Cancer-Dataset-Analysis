Lung cancer remains the biggest threat to the health of a person, becoming the highest risk factor.

To better understand these factors, I worked on Lung Cancer Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL and Power BI, focusing on data cleaning & preprocessing, visualization, and deriving meaningful insights.

✨ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:

✅Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values in Cancer Stage & Treatment Type

✅SQL Queries: Extracted trends on various factors namely, smoking impact, survival years, mortality rates and more.

✅Power BI Dashboard: Designed a 3-page interactive report to visualize key findings

🔍 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:

❖The average count of cigarettes smoked per day being 17, smoking is thus the biggest threat to the health of a person, becoming the highest risk factor.

❖Due to the harmful effect of smoking, 7.07% of the total smokers have been diagnosed with lung cancer, among which around 40% are female with around 59% being male population.

❖Ethiopia, Japan, Turkey, Nigeria & USA are the top 5 countries with largest number of lung cancer cases.

❖It can also be noticed that the non-passive smokers are also highly diagnosed with lung cancer, the number of patients being more than compared to passive smokers.

❖China records the highest lung cancer death count compared to the other countries.
